## A simple weather data provider script for the discontinuated Professional Flight Plan X software.

### How to install :

The folder can be placed anywhere on the computer, a shortcut to the "wx2pfpx.exe" file can be created and put on the Desktop for quick access. The output files are generated and stored in the folder named "output". This folder has to be selected in the PFPX as the "Active Sky" folder (settings on lower bar of screen), the data displayed in PFPX is then automatically refreshed each time the data is updated.


### How to use :

PLEASE NOTE : the program freezes sometimes during processing, this is not an issue, just be patient, the download can sometimes take a few minutes.

Open the script by double clicking on wx2pfpx.exe or the created shortcut on the Desktop.

The script keeps track of last downloaded data and they can be directly browsed, if available, by using the cursor on the right to get through the different forecast times and display them in PFPX.

To download new data, you have the following options : 
- select a starting time (up to 24 hours in the future). 
- The number of forecasts you want to fetch. 
- Using a station network or a grid to import the data. 

Clicking on the download button will generate a new dataset that will be saved on the Hard Drive and replace the previous one.

When available for an airport, the METAR and TAF data is displayed. 

Keep in mind that the weather data source is a free, but limited service. It is designed to prevent abuse and making a lot of requests will increase downloading time or make it fail.


### How it works :

The script fetches raw weather data, METAR and TAF data from the NOAA, US national weather service, which is then compiled to a single file that can be imported in PFPX. The data source is updated 4 times a day, and provides forecasts for every 3 following hours up to 16 days. When available, METAR and TAF data is also provided for more than 5000 airports. 

The station network consists of about 15000 reference airports from PFPX, wind/temperature data is provided for each of them. Moreover about 500 additional stations are used in remote areas. (See stations image file) Imported data is then extrapolated in a grid by PFPX. This allows to access the data quickly and in an optimized way, covering mostly the whole map and fits well for flying on continents with a high airport density.  

For more precisions, it is also possible to generate an output file containing the whole NOAA grid (resolution 1Â°/~111km, 65160 points) (See grid image file) dataset. this takes more time to process, but will cover precisely and homogeneously the whole map. That method could fit better for long haul flights over remote areas.


Main differences with official server :

- Only one single forecast can be displayed and used to compute the whole flight performance.
- When the METAR data is unavailable for an airport, usually the data from the nearest airport is automatically displayed. Here the data is simply not provided.
- The general quality/compatibility, please pay for the official subscription if you can afford it, it will give you what's best and allows to reward the team for their work.


### Troubleshooting :

If you don't get result files in the "output" folder after download and can't restart the app, this is very probably due to the antivirus software preventing the script from writing files. Try to whitelist and empty the "output" folder before trying again.
